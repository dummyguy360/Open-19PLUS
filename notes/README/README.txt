I also did use Apple's SAGE 2019 Decompilation as a base for Project Organization
Although in hindsight it didn't really do much

Also idk the history of this build, but I'm pretty sure its actually a playtester
build of a (now cancelled) mod that planned on bring over Noise Update features with a 19 Plus twist
not entirely sure, but if that's the case then yeah this decomp technically isn't vanilla

But whatever, it's 19 PLUS just with the Noise included
